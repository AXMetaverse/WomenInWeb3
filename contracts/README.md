**DAO Ash√© NFT Marketplace Smart Contract**

This repository contains the DAO Ash√© Marketplace smart contract, which allows users to list, bid, and auction NFTs (ERC-721 tokens) in a decentralized manner. The marketplace also facilitates a marketplace fee for every sale, which goes to the DAO‚Äôs treasury.

‚ú® Features

**Listing NFTs**: Sellers can list their NFTs for auction by specifying a minimum bid price.

**Bidding**: Users can place bids on NFTs. The highest bid is tracked throughout the auction.

**Finalizing Auctions**: The contract owner finalizes auctions, awarding the NFT to the highest bidder.

**Marketplace Fees**: A percentage of the sale is sent to the DAO's treasury as a fee (default is 0.5%)

**Canceling Listings**: Sellers can cancel their listings before the auction is finalized.
